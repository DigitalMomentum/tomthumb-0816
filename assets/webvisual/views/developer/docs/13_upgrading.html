<h3 id=the-quick-way>The Quick Way</h3>
<p>When updates need to be made, I’m just an email away. Cosmetic changes can be updated the easiest by just replacing your
    <strong>/assets</strong> folder with the one in the
    <a href=https://github.com/liquidvisual/loshift-0516/tree/gh-pages>gh-pages</a> repo. Remember the assets folder contains everything that isn’t HTML (images, fonts, JavaScript, CSS).</p>
<h3 id=manually>Manually</h3>
<p>Simply create a new stylesheet or Javascript and link to it in the
    <strong>master.html</strong>. These files can store quick fixes and time sensitive updates. At a later time, they can be absorbed into the Sass files and recompiled with a
    <strong>grunt build</strong>.</p>
<p>In future, when updates are made - one only needs to copy over the
    <strong>dist/assets</strong> folder from the remote repo.</p>

<p>I’m constantly trying to improve this workflow to make porting as smooth as possible. If anything isn’t clear or could be improved, please let me know!</p>
