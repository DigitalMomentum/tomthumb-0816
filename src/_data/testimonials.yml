  body: The branding process presented was clear and engaging and captured the essence of what the brand needed to be. Tom Thumb explained each part of the process and what the objective was and what the outcomes would be. The process was collaborative and we are very pleased with the end result… ‘Rethink Waste’. The branding was delivered on time and within budget.

  body: Tom Thumb partnered with us to run a number of small and large events for one of our brands over 12 months. From the ongoing meetings regarding each event to the registration and communication with our Franchise and supplier network, nothing was too much trouble. Their contribution to the planning and creative ideas to execute make planning simple and slick. To date, Tom Thumb have created animations, training and presentation templates, and video updates to our networks in addition to our off site events for 300 Franchise Partners and their teams. All have been timely and professional. Incredibly easy to work with and as a result they have been engaged to work with another of our brands in an event and creative/production capacity.

  body: Over the past 30 years I have worked with countless marketing agencies, the majority of these companies have fulfilled their brief (albeit not particularly well); very few have exceeded expectations.<br><br>Working with Briony and her team, has without doubt been a highlight, as it is rare to meet a group of individuals that genuinely care about the projects they work on and constantly strive to push the boundaries and deliver a point of difference. HELM have worked in partnership with Tom Thumb since October 2014. Over this time Tom Thumb have completed four projects. In every instance Tom Thumb have delivered well above expectations, often under trying circumstances, with very tight deadlines.
