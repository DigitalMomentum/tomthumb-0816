<h2>Like a great novel the emotion draws you in, whereas the information allows you to understand the plot.</h2>
<p>Every civilization and every person in every country has been storytelling for thousands of years, but businesses often forget the power of a story or they don’t fully appreciate how it affects their performance.</p>
<p>Tom Thumb’s business is to interpret and strengthen your story. We then take the emotion found here and build it into all your offerings and communications.  For your business’s emotion can’t be replicated and therefore can’t be commoditised by someone else. It’s unique to you and that’s valuable.</p><p>But we also know businesses aren’t a homogenous mass, but comprised of various components and offerings that communicate internally and externally.  We’ve developed a model we call Eye-Q that helps businesses evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in their people assets.</p>
<p>But why are people assets valuable? In accounting they appear on the balance sheet as intangibles or goodwill and in some businesses such as Coca Cola these can be massive. They are the value, right now, that we place on our emotional connection with the company.</p>
<p>The result of understanding and then focusing this emotion into all you do inspires people.  Inspiration is the only way to build trust, and this trust then builds relationships.  This is vitally important as relationships grow business that in turn increases profitability and company value.</p>
<p class="lead">We’re here to help you create relationships.</p>
