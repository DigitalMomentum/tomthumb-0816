vision: <p>Le Wrap is one of Australia’s fastest growing franchise chains. They are passionate about delivering fresh and healthy food to their customers. Although their first store opened in 2005 the recent rapid expansion has meant the company’s communication and marketing needed to be updated for future growth.</p>

strategy_execution: <p>Our initial meetings examined their marketing suite and from this the first two components that rapidly needed updating was their website and then their material to attract future franchise partners.</p><p>We consolidated previous work completed by a variety of contractors and then formalised a new style guide that on approval was rolled out across a new website and franchise partner information book.</p><p>Le Wrap was initially skeptical of marketing agencies after a run of bad experiences. We worked closely with them to understand their requirements and then provided them with systems and processes that they could easily understand and worked for them.</p><p>After delivering on time, to budget and to a greater standard than they were expecting we are now their single agency and further work continues on the brand.</p>
