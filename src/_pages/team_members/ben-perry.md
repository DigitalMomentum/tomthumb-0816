Ben founded Tom Thumb in 2013 as a company that specialised in developing inspiring ideas. The ethos of the business is to discover the ‘why’ before looking at how and what we are to do.

The 10 years previous to Tom Thumb, Ben founded and directed Channelzero - a specialist branding agency with offices in Sydney and Newcastle working with some of Australia’s largest brands. He also owns the Newton’s Nation festival and part owner of the Foxy’s Frozen Yogurt brand in the USA. Ben lives in Sydney with Kate and 2 boys.
